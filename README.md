# MyReads

MyReads is a simple cataloging app that allows you to place books in one of three categories.

- Currently Reading

- Read

It also allow you to search for books based on title or author.

This app is the first of three projects required for [Udacity's React Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019).
